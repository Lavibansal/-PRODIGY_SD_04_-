# Sudoku Solver

An Efficient C++ Program to Automatically Solve Sudoku Puzzles üß©
This project implements a Sudoku Solver using the Backtracking algorithm in C++. Given an unsolved 9x9 Sudoku grid, the program fills in the missing numbers while ensuring that the puzzle's rules are followed.

# üî• Features
Automatic Sudoku Solving: Takes an unsolved grid and outputs the correct solution.
Backtracking Algorithm: Efficiently explores possible solutions, backtracking when necessary.
Error Handling: Notifies the user if no solution exists for the given puzzle.
Easy-to-Understand Code: The code is commented for clarity and ease of understanding.

# üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The solver takes a partially filled 9x9 grid where 0 represents empty cells. It attempts to fill each empty cell with a number between 1 and 9, ensuring that the number:

Does not already exist in the same row.
Does not exist in the same column.
Does not exist in the 3x3 subgrid.
Using Backtracking, the program tries different possibilities and reverts if it encounters a conflict, ensuring all possible paths are explored.
